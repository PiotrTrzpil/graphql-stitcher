# graphql-stitcher

Backend development with GraphQL can be exciting too!

- combine all your lambda functions into a single GraphQL schema
- dynamically update the schemas and customise stitching via GraphQL
- need a database as part of the schema? Add https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/ or https://github.com/prismagraphql/prisma
- want a CLI to your functions? Use https://github.com/PiotrTrzpil/gcli
